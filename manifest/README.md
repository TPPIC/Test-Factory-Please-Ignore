# Mod manifest builder

The .json-manifest files are autogenerated and should not be edited by hand.

After changing a .json file, or to update mod versions,run the updater.
This will also update MODS.md.

You have two options for running it:

- On Nix/NixOS, from the root of the repository:
  ````shell
  nix-build -A updater -o updater
  ./updater/bin/updater.py
  ````

- On Windows:

  You should be able to install update.py using `manifest/setup.py install --user`, given
  a working Python installation, but this is untested. Proceed at your own risk, and
  please report back. Once installed, you can run it from the root of the repository, same as above.

- On OS X:

  ```shell
  $ (cd manifest && ./setup.py install --user) && ~/Library/Python/2.7/bin/update.py
  ```

  Alternately, [install Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and use that.

- On Linux:

  You may be able to install the dependencies separately, then run `manifest/update.py` directly.
  Alternately, you can [install Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and use that. Alternately, use setup.py,
  similarly to OS X.

  Something like this might work:
  ````shell
  $ sudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup python-lxml python-futures
  $ python update.py
  ````
