      This is an MCUpdater serverpack directory. If you're reading this,
      then Baughn didn't bother to write a proper webpage.
    <p>
      <b>Important:</b> Before running Minecraft, but after the
      initial update, you must download and add IC2 Classic to the
      pack.
    <p>
      Find it in the IC2-Classic discord. After downloading, copy it
      to &#37;APPDATA&#37;/.MCUpdater/instances/TPPI3C/mods/
    <p>
      Links:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="MCUpdater-Bootstrap.jar">MCUpdater Bootstrap</a><br>

          This is a preconfigured bootstrapper for MCUpdater. If you
          download and run it, you'll get an automatic link for this
          pack. Alternately you can download it from their main
          website and manually add the ServerPack url, below.
        <li><a href="ServerPack.xml">ServerPack</a>.
        <li><a href="packs">Rest of the pack, for manual inspection.</a></li>
      </ul>
